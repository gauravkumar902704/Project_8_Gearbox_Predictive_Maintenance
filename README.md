# ⚙️ Gearbox Predictive Maintenance using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview

This project predicts the health condition of an industrial gearbox using **Machine Learning** and **vibration signal analysis**.

The system extracts statistical features from vibration signals stored in `.txt` files, trains multiple Machine Learning models, automatically selects the best-performing model, and predicts the condition of new gearbox vibration signals through a **Streamlit Web Application**.
