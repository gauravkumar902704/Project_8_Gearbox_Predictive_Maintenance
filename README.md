# 🚀 Gearbox Predictive Maintenance using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

This project predicts the health condition of an industrial gearbox using vibration signal analysis and Machine Learning.

The system extracts statistical features from vibration signals stored in `.txt` files and classifies the gearbox condition into:

- ✅ Healthy
- ❌ Broken Tooth

The project compares multiple Machine Learning algorithms and automatically selects the best-performing model.
